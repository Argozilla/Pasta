     Contributing to Pasta can only be allowed if you were given permission from the lead contributors & developers of Pasta,
     before allowing a new contribute or change the rest of the Pasta developers must discuss the said change. 
     If this is not discussed and/or given permission, we will remove the the contributions to the resporitory by force. 
     Failure to comply with these guidelines for three times will result in not having the ability to contribute to Pasta.
     However we work as a team here and there is no form of dominant power over this so keep that in mind. 
     So comply with the rules and we'll be fine. And all contributions must be involved with Pasta, if it isn't then we will
     remove it. You will be given three warnings before being banned from contributing. We hope you comply with our rules.
