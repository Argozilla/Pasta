Pasta is a web browser project to be released to the public, it's mainly based for YMSH but anyone could use it, it's been developed with Visual Studio Community 2019 as an open source web project. 

Pasta won't collect data, we don't do that here at YMSH. So feel free to browse safely without a corporation-owned web browser.
