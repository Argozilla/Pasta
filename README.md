## Welcome to FrickFad

FrickFad is a web browser project to be released to the public, it's mainly based for YMSH but anyone could use it, it's been developed with Visual Studio Community 2019 as an open source web project. 

FrickFad won't collect data, we don't do that here at YMSH. So feel free to browse safely without a corporation-owned web browser.



### A message from the creator

Hi, I am MethodFarkle, you can call me Barkle. I created this web browser because I thought it would be good for the rest of the YMSH. And possibly other people out there, I hope you put this to good use.
